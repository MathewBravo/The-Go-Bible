# The Building Blocks of Golang

As with most popular programming languages, go is made up of a multitude of files and directories. 

Just like every C++, C and Rust program, Go uses a "main" to act as an entry point to the rest of the program. 

Does this mean that every time I write anything in Go I must have a `package main`. Not necessarily, there may be many times where you create packages that are designed to be extensible or used by other Go programs to complete tasks. Most commonly this type of implementation is called a "shared library".
