# Basic and Composites
Golang is a statically types language, this means that the type of all variables is known at compile time. What this does not mean is that we must specifically declare the type of each variable. Unlike Java, C and C++ go works more similar to Scala and Haskell in which it has the ability to figure out the type we want by the value we are assigning to it. 

## The basic types.
### Integers
### Floats
### Runes
### Booleans
### Strings
### Bytes
### Complex Numbers
## The Composite Types
### Arrays
### Structs
### Slices
### Maps
### Channels
### Pointers
### Functions 
### Interfaces
